This was highlighted as a challenge that directly impacts organizational quality culture development and limits the effectiveness of systematic quality improvement initiatives. The characterization revealed that quality standards education was inconsistent across organizations during their employee orientation programs, making it harder for new employees to fully integrate into their roles and understand quality expectations.\n\nThis gap in quality standards education during onboarding has several implications:\n- Creates inconsistent understanding of quality practices across teams\n- Extends the time needed for new employees to become fully productive\n- Increases the risk of quality-related issues in software development\n- May lead to higher costs due to rework and inefficiencies\n- Can impact the overall development of organizational quality culture\n\nThe discussion suggested addressing this through standardized onboarding frameworks and structured quality standards documentation as part of the solution.",
